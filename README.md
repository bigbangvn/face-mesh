A demo app for showing off the iPhone X TrueDepth camera.

Current settings allow for the following:

- Show the face mesh in wireframe mode.
- Disable the camera view to only show the face mesh.
- Disable real world based lighting. Note: this will effectively show the face mesh with no lighting at all and only works well in wireframe mode.

There's also an option to export the current face pose in Collada .dae file format. This is experimental and has only been tested importing into Blender 2.78. I can't guarantee it'll work in other 3D modelling software.

No dependencies. Just load into XCode and select your provisioning profile.
